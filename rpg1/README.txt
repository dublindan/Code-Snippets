RPG 1 is a very simple, but fully playable, RPG-like dungeon crawl game.
It is intentionally simple, to serve as an example of how an RPG could be
implemented.

Graphics:
Released in the public domain, as far as I know.
Please email me to correct me if I'm wrong.

Code:
Public domain, do with it whatever you wish. If
you do use it though, please let me know. Id like
to know where it ends up.
